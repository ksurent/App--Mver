NAME
    App::Mver - just print modules' $VERSION (and some other stuff)

DESCRIPTION
    For those, who are sick of

        perl -MLong::Module::Name -le'print Long::Module::Name->VERSION'

    The main purpose of this simple stupid tool is to save you some typing.

    It will report you the following things (some of them require command
    line arguments):

    your installed version of the given module(s)
    whether or not your current version is the last one available on CPAN
    whether or not the module is included in Perl distribution
    changes between installed and latest version
